# Spplice Terms of Service

**Effective Date:** 2024-08-15

Welcome to Spplice! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Spplice software ("Application") and the Spplice global repository ("Repository"), collectively referred to as "Services." By downloading, installing, or using Spplice, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Services.

## 1. **Introduction**
Spplice, which stands for "Simple Portal 2 Package Loading Instrument for Convenient External modding," is a tool designed to facilitate the installation of packages (mods) for Portal 2 in a user-friendly manner. The Spplice global repository hosts various packages that users can download and install via the Application.

## 2. **Use of the Services**
- **Application:** You are permitted to download and use Spplice on any device you own or control for the purpose of, but not limited to installing and managing packages for Portal 2.
- **Repository:** You may download and install packages from the Spplice global repository for use with Portal 2, provided that you comply with these Terms and any additional terms provided with specific packages.

## 3. **Prohibited Uses**
- **Illegitimate Copies:** Using Spplice or any packages from the Repository on an illegitimate copy of Portal 2 is strictly prohibited. Doing so can lead to the game malfunctioning irreversibly, and Spplice is not responsible for any damages or issues that arise from such use.
- **Reverse Engineering:** While Spplice is not currently open-source, reverse engineering the Application is permitted under the condition that you do not publicly distribute any reverse-engineered versions or derivatives without prior permission. We reserve the right to open-source Spplice in the future, at which point separate licensing terms may apply.
- **Misuse:** You agree not to use the Services for any illegal, harmful, or unauthorized purposes, including but not limited to distributing malicious software, violating intellectual property rights, or disrupting the functionality of Spplice or the Repository. You also acknowledge that this section is not necessarily an exhaustive list of prohibited uses, and any use of the Services performed not in good faith may fall under misuse.

## 4. **Intellectual Property**
- **Spplice Software:** The Application, including its code, design, and documentation, is the intellectual property of [PortalRunner](https://p2r3.com/) ("Owner"). All rights not expressly granted to you are reserved.
- **Packages:** Packages available in the Repository _may_ be subject to their own licenses and intellectual property rights as defined by their respective creators. You are responsible for complying with any such licenses if present.

## 5. **Modding and Package Use**
- **Compatibility:** Spplice is designed to work with legitimate copies of Portal 2, and interfaces with Steam and Portal 2 to communicate essential data relevant for package installation and functionality. Use of packages from the Repository on an illegitimate copy of the game may cause irreversible damage or malfunction. Spplice is not responsible for any issues arising from the use of the Services in an unsupported manner.
- **Risk of Use:** Installing and using mods can potentially alter your game experience. While Spplice is designed to minimize risks, you acknowledge that using mods involves inherent risks, including game instability or data loss. You use Spplice and the packages at your own risk.

## 6. **Updates and Changes**
- **Application Updates:** Spplice may automatically download and install updates to improve the functionality, security, or compatibility of the Application. By using Spplice, you agree to receive such updates.
- **Terms Updates:** These Terms may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes through the Application. Your continued use of the Services after any updates constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.

## 7. **Termination**
We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to the Services at any time without notice, for conduct that we believe violates these Terms or is harmful to other users, us, or third parties.

## 8. **Disclaimer of Warranties**
The Services are provided "as is" and "as available" without any warranties of any kind, express or implied. We do not warrant that the Services will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components. Your use of Spplice is at your own risk.

## 9. **Limitation of Liability**
To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses resulting from your use of the Services.
